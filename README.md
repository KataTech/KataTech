I study a mixture of mathematics, statistics, and computer science at the beautiful Rice University in Houston, Texas. My expertise is in the analysis and alignment of networks through computational optimal transport. While I identify as a researcher first, much of my experience is in transforming mathematical models into software infrastructure that acts on real-world data from food web networks, social media, RNA sequencing tools, and human behaviors in psychological experiments. 

A few things that I care a lot about are... AI safety, applications of ML to cancer treatment and drug discovery, open-world fantasy video games, sci-fi books that cast a new light on existential crisis, and cooking authentic Chinese soups to make my parents proud. 

For a more professional overview of my work, you can find me on LinkedIn or visit my personal website at katatech.github.io.
