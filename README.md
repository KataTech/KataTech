Welcome! I am Kai, a CS ðŸ’» and STAT ðŸ“ˆ student at Rice University who's broadly interested in machine learning, bayesian statistics, graph theory, computational social science, and AI for healthcare. Here on my Github, you will find some publicly available personal (data-driven) projects of mine, but my most interesting work are hidden away in private repositories affiliated with research labs at Rice University and RiceApps, a student-centered app development organization on our campus.
